Data Analytics refers to the process of examining available datasets to draw conclusions about the information they contain. This enables us to take raw data and discover patterns to extract valuable insights from it. Thus, we performed descriptive data analytics on Stackoverflow to discover useful information, analyse trends and draw conclusions.

We aimed to collect data using Web Scraping instead of using survey data which is already available. Success of any data analysis depends heavily on the quality of data. We then performed the analysis and interpreted results by creating visualizations and interpretations.
Additionally, we have provided the user with a freedom to do the analysis on any domain and have provided various options for them to do the analysis
